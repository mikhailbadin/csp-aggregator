# CSP Aggregator

CSP aggregator is a service that accepts and processes [Content-Security-Policy Report](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP2/). After receiving the CSP Report, logs it to [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), and also does the processing, after which it sends it to [CSP-Store](https://github.com/mikhailbadin/csp-store) (works in [TarantoolDB](https://tarantool.io/)) for further analysis.

- `TARANTOOL_USER` - username
- `TARANTOOL_PASS` - password

Example configuration:

```shell
# Server configuration
SERVER_ADDR=":8080"

# MongoDB configuration
MONGO_URI="127.0.0.1:27017"

# TarantoolDB configuration
TARANTOOL_URL="127.0.0.1:3301"
TARANTOOL_USER="guest"
TARANTOOL_PASS=""
```
